a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
var rideLine = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]

 b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.
var newPerson = rideLine.push(“Mary”)

 c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).
var findPerson = rideLine.indexOf(“Josh”)

 d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?
var findEm = rideLine.indexOf(“Emily”)
If the function does not find Emily, it would return an 'error'

 e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?
var cutLine = rideLine.splice(1, 0, “Melissa”)

 f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?
var leftLine = rideLine.splice(3, 1)

1. There is a line of traffic in the George Washington tunnel. The line is composed of cars, motorcycles, and trucks represented as strings. There is a front and a back of the line. When new vehicles enter the traffic, they are added to the back. Vehicles may merge in and out of the traffic.

var traffic = [ “red van”, “white car”, “black suv”, “blue motorcycle”, “red truck”]

2. Like the prior example, developers can manipulate all parts of this data. Vehicles may be added, removed, and switch positions in the array.
