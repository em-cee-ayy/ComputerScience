Short Answer

1. Programmers use pseudocode as a way to brainstorm before writing their code.

2. If you run pseudocode in your computer, nothing will happen since it is not written in actual code. It is only meant for humans to read as an outline.

Programming

1.
INPUT number1 and number2
IF number1 is greater than number2 THEN
  PRINT number1
ELSE
  PRINT number2
END IF

2.
READ number
INIT i to 1
WHILE i < 100
  DO:
  WRITE i
  INCREMENT i
END WHILE

3.
FUNCTION phoneBook(name)
INPUT name
  FOR loop from first entry to last
    IF name === phoneBook[i].name
    RETURN phoneBook[i].number
    END IF
  END FOR
  RETURN "Name does not exist"

4.
var phoneBook = [
{name: 'Jane', phone: '1231231234'},
{name: 'Bill', phone: '1231241234'},
{name: 'John', phone: '1231221234'}
]

function phoneBook.filter(entry => {
return entry.name === "Bill" ? entry.phone : "Name does not exist"
})
